# MagazinePatcher
#### Better Magazine Spawning!

MagazinePatcher is an H3VR mod which assigns more magazines to compatible firearms. 

**Did You Know:** Normally, magazines and clips are assigned to firearms by hand in H3VR?

This is not ideal, as some firearms can only spawn with one or two magazines, when it ***could*** spawn with several!

### Why should you use MagazinePatcher?
- It allows modded weapons to spawn with magazines
- It adds variety to magazine drops in TNH
- It provides important datastructures which other mods can use to get compatible magazines
